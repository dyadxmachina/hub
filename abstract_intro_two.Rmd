# Introduction
## Intro 

Whether it's been science, philosophy, or artificial intelligence, huamnswe have always found ourselves at odds with our existences. Why do we exist? Many have tired to approach this question with varying degrees of illumination. It But there are still more questions than there are answers. Artificial intelligence has become a salient mirror just as the industrial revolution made us realise what type of work "humans" should be doing, and therefore illuminated what we valued as humans. F We moved away from the endlessness of the question of why are we here and immediately moved to what Bourdieu called Distinction. What makes us different?. Of all the sciences that have begin to answer the question, progress in the field of neurobiology, computer science, artificial intelligence, primatology, anthropology, and sociology have all played a role in thinning the line between us and other animals just as Netwonian physics have told us that we may not be alone, that we may not be the centre of the universe. Monkeys with tools, dolphins and casual sex, Elephans and their endless memory, and the bees way of social organising shortened our view of humans as distinct.ButAs Ernest Becker has said, we are half animal and half symbolic andso we find ourselves valuing what isseems more abstract and less grounded in the flesh. Descarte and Aristole came to similar conclusion sabout the question. What makes us hman is reason, our ability to detached ourselves from our feelings and reason. But how to reason properly? . We will In parallelle other scientists looked to Darwin and a more biological view of intelligence. As thestudies on the nervous system became more and more advanceds, we moved from psychological theory grounded in observational research to looking  at networks of neurons and how they react to certain stimulus. This lead to neuroscience which was slowly uncovering that our central nervous system, i tthe key to our most profound features. Our cognition, thinking, reasoning, perceiving, and learning and memory. This would eventually lead to the cognitive revolution where many scientists from differing fields came to study the brain  and mental activitiy happeningin ourselves and other animals. It is obvious now, that this would lead to a want to emulate the central nervous system and . Can we emulate the brain and would that then give us keys to intelligence? Could that give us have conciousness an? AI seemed is an approach to answer such questions. We still no very little about how we reason an, learn, and experience everyday life. We can see AI as two tracks, applied AI, and philosophical AI. The first deals with cerating industrial applications and the second AIis around understanding intelligence. AI is both a tool and a mirror. So the hype will always exist because we do not know what makes us human and what we can and cannot emulate. AI has a chance at being a tool we use to make the world better or worse, and it also gives us a mirror into our world and what it means to exist.
