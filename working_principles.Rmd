# From objects to human constructs

> from classifying the number of people in a photo or the types of animal to seeing the amount of "gratitude" or frustration levels shown in a video)

# From rational to full human being

> from looking at humans through utlity theory, basic demography to taking in the full complexity of the individual and their context (cognitive, affective, behaviour, enviornment, situation). 

# From modern hedonistic inspired design towards human flourishing and self-mastery

> I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves. - Wittgenstein
